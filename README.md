# Predicting-Student-Future-Performance
In this project, the main aim is to build a predictive model using regression and deep learning to determine the future performance of students in a school.
A data set contains information about students like scores and deomographic information. 
Three seperate data from students in different grades that is; grade 10, grade 11 and grade 12 was used.

The data set included features such as;
  Student_id	
  Student_name
  Class	
  Province_of_residence	Gender	
  Languages_Overall	Sciences_Overall	
  Humanities_Overall	
  Summer_programs_attended	
  Years of High school study
  Subjects : These subjects are based on two curriculums; the international curriculum and the national curriculum
  International_curriculum_total
  National _curriculum_total
  
This data was cleaned, and some feature engineering performed to prepare it for model training.
Some data exploration was performed using to show patterns between different features of the data set.

Different models were trained on the data and the performing model selected depending on its R score.
