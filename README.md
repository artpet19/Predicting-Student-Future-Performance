# Predicting-Student-Future-Performance
In this project, the aim is to build a prediction model using regression and deep learning to predict the future performance among students
A data set containg students scores for three classes was provided
The data set included;
Student_id	
Student_name	
Class	
Province_of_residence	Gender	
Languages_Overall	Sciences_Overall	
Humanities_Overall	
Summer_programs_attended	
Years of High school study
Subjects : These subjects are based on two curriculums; the international curriculum and the national curriculum
International_curriculum_total
National _curriculum_total
The data was cleaned, and some feature engineering performed to prepare it for training
Visulizations were performed to show the trend between different relationships of the data
Different models were used to get the model that gives the best R score
